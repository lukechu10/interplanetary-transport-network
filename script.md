You are stuck in a spaceship orbiting around the moon and you wish to come back home. But fuel is running low and you realise that you do not have enough to make a transfer burn back to Earth. What do you do? Perhaps making a transfer burn is not the only way to get back.

To find an answer, we must be able to predict the future. Given an initial condition, where will we end up?

To predict the future, we will need many tools. We will start by building a tracer and later on, we will use many tools such as phase space, Lagrange points, stable and unstable manifolds, so that we can eventually find a way to get back home, and to get to any other part of the solar system.

## Building a tracer

But first, let's build a tracer. What this does is simple. Simulate the tracjectories of a spacecraft under influence of some other masses.
