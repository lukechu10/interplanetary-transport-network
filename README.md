## Build instructions

**Dependencies**:

- Up to date installation of Rust.
- Up to date installation of Python.
- ManimCE v0.18
- Make

Run all the simulations first by running `make run-all-simulations`.
Then render all the videos by running `make build-video-all q=h`. (Beware, this will take some time!)

This will generate videos into a `media/` folder. To build the slides, run `make build-slides-html` which will generate the final slides into the `docs/` folder.
